Project 4 - Wordblocks:

	Wordblocks is a two-player word building game where the end goal is to earn more points than your opponent by building longer words and taking over the board. 
	Players can "stomp" over their opponent's letters to reduce their score. 
	Each play is checked against a standard oxford english dictionary to validate it is a real word before awarding points.

Features:

	- Ability to play multiple games with multiple people

	- Email-id based game sessions

	- Turn based gameplay

	- Dictionary based backend word validation

	- Ability to delete and create new sessions

	- Ability to Auto-resume running game sessions


Additional info:

	To simulate two player sessions, create a new game in one browser window and then open another browser in "incognito" or "private browsing" mode and log in as the invited player. 
	This will allow you to play against yourself to simulate the multi-player interaction.
